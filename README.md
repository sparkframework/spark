# Spark â€” A Classy Web Framework for Rapid Development

Spark is a full stack framework built on top of [Silex][], made for
Rapid Development in the same spirit as Ruby on Rails.

Spark is a framework for people who believe:

* The structure of most applications are nearly the same.
* Convention > Configuration
* Asset management should be shipped out of the box.
* ORMs solve 80% of problems.

Building a framework is of course a _huge_ project, so there isn't
nearly all done. This is what works for now:

* Application generator.
* Asset Pipeline based on [Pipe](http://github.com/CHH/pipe), with
  deployment support.
* Action Controllers with Action and View Helpers built on Traits, and
  support for multiple templating strategies.
* Basic framework for generators.
* Extensible command line utility based on Symfony Console.

## Quick Start

### Create an Application

First get the `spark` executable:

    % wget http://chh.github.com/spark/spark.phar

Then invoke the `create` command and grab some coffee while Composer
installs all dependencies:

    % php spark.phar create MyApp

Go into the application directory and start a development server:

    % cd MyApp
    % ./vendor/bin/spark server

Then open <http://localhost:3000> in your browser, you should see "Hello
World" in big letters.

### Controllers

Controllers make your application do things when someone views it in
their browser. Controllers go into the directory `app/controllers/`, 
and are best generated by the `generate controller` command:

    % spark.phar generate controller user

If you open up `app/controllers/MyApp/UserController.php`
you should see this:

```php
<?php

namespace MyApp;

class UserController
{
    function indexAction()
    {
    }
}
```

Each controller consists of actions. Each action is a public method of
the controller class, and ends with "Action".

The HTML goes into a "View". The view's file name gets taken from the
controller and action name. For example for the "index" action in the 
"UserController" the view "user/index.phtml" gets used.

Put this into `app/views/user/index.phtml`:

```html
<h1>Hello World <?= $this->name ?>!</h1>
```

The view has access to each property of the controller class. This
allows you to pass variables from the controller to the view. Also add
the parameter `name` to the method, we will need it later.

```php
<?php

namespace MyApp;

class UserController
{
    function indexAction($name)
    {
        $this->name = $name;
    }
}
```

The last part of getting our controller to do something (remotely)
useful, is to add a route. A Route connects a URI to a controller and
action. Routes are configured in `config/routes.php`.

This will do for now:

```php
$routes->match('/user/{name}', 'user#index');
```

That thing within the curly braces is a variable, which gets extracted
from the URI and then gets assigned the name `name`. We've previously
declared that our action needs an argument `name`, so Spark figures this
out and passes the route variable along to the action.

Last but not least, we assign the controller and action to the route.
This is done with `$controller#$action`. Controller names are converted
from `under_score` to `UnderScore` and then suffixed with `Controller`.
So `user` gets transformed to `UserController`.

If you open <http://localhost:3000/John%20Doe> in your browser you
should see "Hello World John Doe!" in big letters.
